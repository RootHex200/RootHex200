### Cover Letter
I've been into app development for about a year now, mainly using a cool tool called Flutter. My focus is making apps workreally smoothly, look great, and run efficiently.

I'm always eager to learn and keep up with the latest tech trends. I've become quite handy with things like building thebehind-the-scenes part of apps, making them look nice, and figuring out how to make them run fast.I have honed my skills andexpertise in clean architecture, design patterns, data structures and algorithms. I've also finished a bunch of my ownprojects, and now I'm aiming to help out in the open-source Flutter and Dart community.
